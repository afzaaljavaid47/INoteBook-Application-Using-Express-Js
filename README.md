# INoteBook Application Using Express JS

## Abstract

This project is an iNoteBook application developed using Express JS. It provides a RESTful API for managing personal notes, user authentication, and note categorization. The backend is designed to handle various operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes. The primary objective of this project is to provide a robust and scalable server-side solution for personal note-taking and organization.

## Introduction

The iNoteBook Application Backend is designed to serve as the server-side component for managing personal notes. Built with Express JS, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, this project demonstrates the use of server-side JavaScript to handle API requests and database operations. The backend connects to a database to store notes and user data. This project highlights essential server-side development practices such as routing, middleware usage, database interactions, and authentication.

### Features

- RESTful API for managing notes and user data.
- User authentication and authorization using JWT.
- CRUD operations for notes.
- Note categorization and tagging.
- Middleware for error handling and logging.
- Secure API endpoints with proper validation.

## Tools and Techniques

This project utilizes several tools and techniques to build a robust and efficient iNoteBook backend application:

- **Express JS**: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies server-side development.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows for server-side execution of JavaScript.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing notes and user data.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and secure API endpoints.
- **Express Middleware**: For handling requests, errors, and logging.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **body-parser**: For parsing incoming request bodies in middleware.
- **bcrypt**: For hashing user passwords.
- **Mocha and Chai**: For testing the API endpoints.
- **ESLint and Prettier**: Tools for maintaining code quality and formatting.
- **Git and GitHub**: Version control and collaboration platform.

By combining these tools and techniques, the iNoteBook Application Backend provides a comprehensive and practical approach to building a scalable and secure server-side application.
